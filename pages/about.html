        <p id="about-work-ethics" class="about-p">
            Every working day I try to develop high-quality code and programs.
            As a data scientist I try to be curious, precise and clearly explain my results.
            I appreciate appropriate task planning and a kind of freedom in colleagues relationships.
            I often use a sense of humor to improve the atmosphere in a team.
            Potential problems or conflicts should be solved up to date.
